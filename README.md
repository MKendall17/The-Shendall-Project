## Statement of problem
Return the boolean value of the statement “there exists a path through a maze starting at a designated beginning ending at treasure”, where looping is disallowed.

## Recursive abstraction
When I am asked to know whether there exists a path from a node to the treasure, the recursive abstraction can know whether there exists a path to the treasure from one of the adjacent nodes.
