-## Statement of problem
-Return the boolean value of the statement “there exists a path through a maze starting at a designated beginning ending at treasure”, with looping (redundant pathing) disallowed.
-
-## Recursive abstraction
-When I am asked to evaluate whether there exists a path from a node to the treasure, the recursive abstraction can evaluate whether there exists a path to the treasure from one of the adjacent nodes.
-
-## Base case
-if (current node is treasure) return true  
-else if (current node is null or current node is marked) return false  
-
-## English or pseudocode description of algorithm
-mark current node  
-for each neighboring node:  
-&nbsp;&nbsp;
-  if (recursive abstraction called on this node is true) return true  
-unmark current node  
-return false  
-
-## Additional notes
-Every node has 4 neighboring nodes.  
-Each node has a distinct location and can be null.  
-Marked nodes represent the path that the program is testing.
